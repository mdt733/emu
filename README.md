# EMU — a little robot learning to walk

**Six servos · One dynamically unstable biped · One learned policy**

EMU learns to balance, walk, turn, survive disturbances and negotiate
real slopes and steps. Its footsteps are **not scripted**: the robot
learns six servo commands using PPO reinforcement learning in
thousands of parallel MuJoCo/MJX physics worlds.

Six *teaching focuses* practise commands, slopes, supported steps,
resilience, command transitions and economical control. They are
different groups of **training environments**, not six networks.

The current policy observes **360 inputs**: 90 deployable sensor
and command fields across four history frames, including 4×4
forward ToF range/validity signals. The teacher can inspect
precise simulator contacts to decide whether a skill succeeded,
but those privileged facts are **not actor inputs**.

## Current baseline — v5032 Pinnacle 260M

<small>First released 360-input generation · 31 October 2026</small>

| Attribute | Released baseline |
|---|---|
| Policy | **v5032 Pinnacle, 260,046,848 world steps** |
| Source used for training | `9b11bbe596aea7201d29a6beb2d192922f8e2e9a` |
| Inputs / outputs | 360 observation inputs / six servo targets |
| Run | 2,048 parallel GPU worlds, seed 761, cold start |
| Published actor | `showcase/champion.emupolicy` |
| Reproducibility | Export identity, sensor schema and checkpoint hash in `showcase/release_approval.json` |
| Previous public champion | 232-input policy at Git commit `2ec9e9db0a816c658131311129ef89ec7a595a12` |

It walks supported 2 cm upsteps reliably (8/8), is partially
successful at 2.5 cm (4/8), and does **not yet** reliably
climb 3 cm (0/8). It survives 12° downhill in all 16 frozen
worlds but passes the full *heading-controlled mission* in
only 4/16. At a requested 0.8 m/s, 12/16 survive 14 seconds,
but none pass the strict full heading/path mission.

That's a useful, measured new baseline—not a declaration
that the research is finished or that the new model surpasses
the old one on **every** test.

| How do terrain, springs, physics and sensor noise work? | `emu/environment.py` |
| What does PPO pay for? | `emu/rewards.py` |
| Who selects the next lesson/difficulty? | `emu/curriculum.py`, `emu/capability_focus.py` |
| What keeps physical competence evidence? | `emu/capability_field.py` |
| Where is the actor, critic and update? | `emu/ppo.py`, `emu/training.py` |
| Who validates checkpoints and source lineage? | `emu/run.py`, `emu/checkpoint_io.py` |
| Who runs independent physical exams? | `emu/physical_exam.py`, `emu/evaluation.py` |
| Who serves the trained bird and browser MuJoCo? | `emu/viewer_server.py`, `emu/viewer_src/` |
| What makes a public policy release safe to publish? | `scripts/verify_showcase_release.py` |
| Where are the old experiments and next questions? | `docs/history/`, [issue #17](https://github.com/mdt733/emu/issues/17) |

[**The end-to-end architecture map**](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)
explains each boundary: actor vs teacher, teaching vs independent
exam, saved learner vs exported actor, and local viewer vs Pages.

## Three useful things to run

After following [INSTALL](docs/INSTALL.md) and activating the
checkout's Python environment:

```bash
# Check the checked-in public model, sensor contract and exact approval.
python scripts/verify_showcase_release.py

# Build and view the released actor in the local browser.
python -m emu.cli viewer-build
python -m emu.cli viewer showcase/champion.emupolicy \
  --no-open --port 8765

# Independent frozen physics challenge, no PPO training.
python -m emu.cli capability-exam \
  --policy showcase/champion.emupolicy \
  --output ~/robot_lab/emu_exams/pinnacle_260m \
  --device cpu --quick
```

The viewer offers live-checkpoint following and eight graduated,
real-collision park obstacles. The park is an interactive
diagnostic, **not** a held-out MJX physical certification.

### Want to train a new robot?

The completed v5032 cold-start launcher is preserved as
`scripts/train_pinnacle.py` and its [historical runbook](docs/PINNACLE_CANDIDATE.md).
**It is not the next automatically recommended experiment.**
To reproduce the exact released training source, use its original
frozen Git SHA and independently backed-up full `final.pkl`
checkpoint. Don't rerun a 260M campaign or transplant an
optimizer merely because a branch exists.

A `.pkl` holds optimizer, normalizer and curriculum state;
an `.emupolicy` is an inference-only actor with a sensor
contract. Full checkpoints are not in Git; keep external backups.

## What's next?

We are **not** immediately running 24 new science arms.
The abandoned experiment sketch remains available at
`research/v5033-24-arm-science`, but its reward changes
were not validated or incorporated into this released robot.

Our [research backlog](https://github.com/mdt733/emu/issues/17)
starts with better downhill/path steering measurements, real
2.5–3 cm support transfer, torso crouch and stored spring
energy, fast controllable gait and meaningful J/m. Organic
terrain comes later. Future work gets one clear hypothesis
and a comparable physical exam before another full training.
