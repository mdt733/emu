# EMU — a little robot learning to walk

**Six servos · One dynamically unstable biped · One learned policy**

EMU learns to balance, walk, turn, survive disturbances and negotiate
real slopes and steps. Its footsteps are **not scripted**: the robot
learns six servo commands using PPO reinforcement learning in
thousands of parallel MuJoCo/MJX physics worlds.

Six *teaching focuses* practise commands, slopes, supported steps,
resilience, command transitions and economical control. They are
different groups of **training environments**, not six networks.

The current policy observes **360 inputs**: 90 deployable sensor
and command fields across four history frames, including 4×4
forward ToF range/validity signals. The teacher can inspect
precise simulator contacts to decide whether a skill succeeded,
but those privileged facts are **not actor inputs**.

## Cold-start learning curve — don't mistake age for competence

EMU starts with **random policy weights**; it is a dynamically unstable
six-servo biped, not a pre-programmed standing or walking controller.
The following is the owner's **historical, approximate observation**,
not a source-pinned, controlled learning-curve measurement:

| Total world steps | What is reasonable to expect |
|---|---|
| **~0–5M** | Discovery period: generally falls; even standing on flat ground is not yet reliably learned. |
| **~5M** | First signs of learning to **stand on boring, flat ground**; not proof of reliable balance, gait or terrain skills. |
| **~20M** | The v5046 source-pinned 20M trial now shows reliable **low-speed** held-out survival and ~0.094 m/s achieved mean forward speed; this is not yet champion-equivalent or verified step-climbing. Earlier generations learned more slowly. |
| **~40M** | Early, **infant-like gait development** rather than mature controlled walking. |
| **Later** | Meaningful speed, directional control, slopes and supported step crossing must be verified on **frozen physical exams** at the same source, sensor contract and seed. |

Timing varies with seed, architecture and curriculum. **No global
mastery gate** should block all six specialist populations until
another specialty succeeds. Conversely, do not call a 131k-step
smoke policy broken because it falls: those tests validate physics,
PPO, memory and checkpoints, **not learned locomotion**.
See the [foundation / six-specialist curriculum](docs/UNIFIED_CAPABILITY_GROWTH.md)
and [active engineering handover](HANDOVER.md).

## Current baseline — v5032 Pinnacle 260M

<small>First released 360-input generation · 31 October 2026</small>

| Attribute | Released baseline |
|---|---|
| Policy | **v5032 Pinnacle, 260,046,848 world steps** |
| Source used for training | `9b11bbe596aea7201d29a6beb2d192922f8e2e9a` |
| Inputs / outputs | 360 observation inputs / six servo targets |
| Run | 2,048 parallel GPU worlds, seed 761, cold start |
| Published actor | `showcase/champion.emupolicy` |
| Reproducibility | Export identity, sensor schema and checkpoint hash in `showcase/release_approval.json` |
| Previous public champion | 232-input policy at Git commit `2ec9e9db0a816c658131311129ef89ec7a595a12` |

It **physically crosses** 2 cm upsteps in 8/8 worlds, but
only 3/8 pass the **full movement-and-heading mission**.
At 2.5 cm the supported crossing rate is 4/8 (mission 3/8);
at 3 cm, supported ascent is still 0/8. It survives 12° downhill in all 16 frozen
worlds but passes the full *heading-controlled mission* in
only 4/16. At a requested 0.8 m/s, 12/16 survive 14 seconds,
but none pass the strict full heading/path mission.

That's a useful, measured new baseline—not a declaration
that the research is finished or that the new model surpasses
the old one on **every** test.

[**The five-stage core skeleton and cleanup plan**](docs/CORE_SKELETON.md)
is the current entry point from source-pinned `emu train` through
procedural MJX physics, PPO, physical exams, export and local viewer.
The [original architecture in Git](https://github.com/mdt733/emu/blob/a2f59bb31bec049204b60a3eb86500b100db039f/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) remains
available for preserved legacy interfaces.

## Three useful things to run

After following [INSTALL](docs/INSTALL.md) and activating the
checkout's Python environment:

```bash
# Check the checked-in public model, sensor contract and exact approval.
python scripts/verify_showcase_release.py

# Build and view the released actor in the local browser.
python -m emu.cli viewer-build
python -m emu.cli viewer showcase/champion.emupolicy \
  --no-open --port 8765

# The shipped champion uses historical training physics. Its original
# physical exams live in the pinned v5044/pre-cleanup Git history;
# never substitute modern prism contacts and call it a matched baseline.
```

The viewer offers live-checkpoint following and eight graduated,
real-collision park obstacles. The park is an interactive
diagnostic, **not** a held-out MJX physical certification.

### Want to train a new robot?

The completed v5032 launcher is preserved at its original source SHA
`9b11bbe596aea7201d29a6beb2d192922f8e2e9a`, together with its
[historical runbook in Git](https://github.com/mdt733/emu/blob/a2f59bb31bec049204b60a3eb86500b100db039f/docs/PINNACLE_CANDIDATE.md). It no longer lives
in active `scripts/`. New source-pinned robots begin with `emu train`.
To reproduce the exact released training source, use its original
frozen Git SHA and independently backed-up full `final.pkl`
checkpoint. Don't rerun a 260M campaign or transplant an
optimizer merely because a branch exists.

A `.pkl` holds optimizer, normalizer and curriculum state;
an `.emupolicy` is an inference-only actor with a sensor
contract. Full checkpoints are not in Git; keep external backups.

## Current development (5 November 2026)

**v5046** on draft [PR #35](https://github.com/mdt733/emu/pull/35)
uses four recycled 75 cm tiles, eight actual convex triangular-prism
colliders, one six-specialist 360-input policy and 2,048 GPU worlds.
A 34-arm solver experiment found 119,662 steady full-PPO steps/s
with the experimental **2 Newton / 4 linesearch** limits versus
31,974 with unchanged defaults. The stronger contact/physics checks
have **not** certified 2/4 as a hardware-faithful default.

The first continuous 20M cold-start (seed 735) completed at 20.054M
steps with 2.1% latest training fall fraction, 0.094 m/s measured
mean forward speed and a +0.530 held-out broad score, up from
-0.089 at 10M. Core/stress30/dynamic50/combo70 physical panels
survived 350 frames, but verified vertical-step successes remain
zero and the champion's speed/control are not yet matched.
[**Measured results and promotion gates**](docs/V5046_OVERNIGHT_RESULTS_20261105.md).

The disposable 34-arm research harness has been removed in
draft [cleanup PR #36](https://github.com/mdt733/emu/pull/36);
only its measurements survive. The maintained core has **21 Python
tests**, with a ceiling of 24, plus browser and real-physics checks.
We keep a source-pinned training checkout intact until its run is
finished, and keep the published `main` champion protected.
